A running AsyncTask becomes disconnected from the activity and stops running, preserving system resources. A running AsyncTaskLoader automatically restarts execution of its task from the beginning. The activity displays the results.

Question 5

In onCreateLoader() in the activity, create an instance of the AsyncTaskLoader subclass. In the loader's constructor, perform initialization tasks.
